## About the Project

I created this project by following [the tutorial in the React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

**Features I Added:**
* On the current move, "You are at move #..." is displayed (instead of a button)
* When building the `Board`, two loops are used instead of hardcoding the content
* A toggle button is displayed which lets users sort the moves in either ascending or descending order
* When someone wins, the three squares that caused the win are highlighted
* When no one wins, a message is displayed stating the result is a draw
